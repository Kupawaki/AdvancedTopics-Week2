# AdvancedTopics-Week2

This weeks progress was swift and efficient, especially in contrast to last week. As it turns out, tabbed applications are far, far easier to create, manage, and understand when compared to navigation drawers. And unlike my navigation drawer POC, which has a lot of frayed and tangled ends, this weeks POC is nearly flawless when it comes to having a template to create tabbed apps in the future.

Something I found interesting is that you can put the tabs wherever you wish. I sort of forget sometimes when I am working with an emulator that these apps are designed for a phone, and thus, putting tabs at the top of the screen doesnt make any sense, from now on they will be located at the bottom, where a thumb could easily reach them. I also like how the tabs are essentially just simple buttons, and are easy to change and modify (size, color, position, paddings, margins, etc.)

Accounting everything, this week I learned
1. That navigation bars were a horrible place to start this course (My Bad)
2. I should have been using tabbed applications long ago, considering how clean and useful they are
3. A great tutorial can make all the difference in the world.
